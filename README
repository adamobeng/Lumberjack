**lumberjack** is a Python script for making EPUB3 media overlays
allows you to step through an input file (either the XHTML files
contained within an EPUB file, or a single source TEI XML file) while playing
the corresponding audio transcript, in order to synchronise the two.
**lumbjerjack** produces as output an Audacity-format label file (extension 
'.txt'), which it can then transformed into the appropriate SMIL files for 
inclusion in an EPUB 3 book, or a TEI XML <timeline> element for re-insertion
 into the source file.


See docs/lumberjack.html for much more documentation (generated by Pycco from comments in the source file).
